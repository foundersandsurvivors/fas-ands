  <description type="brief">Complete population of female convicts who arrived in [[[VDL]]] during the initial period of transportation, as represented by CON40.</description>
<description type="full">
<p>Authoritative register of convicts in Founders and Survivors population category 3.</p>

<p>This index repesents the complete set of convicts who make up population category 3 of the Founders and Survivors project. This category covers all female convicts entering the [[[VDL]]] convict system in the assignment period, from 1818 to approximately 1840. These are represented by the project's transcriptions of every CON40 entry - female convict conduct records.</p>

<p>This convict population is presented in CON40 physical (imaged) sequence in 10 volumes. Alternate presentations for sequence can be made available but this physical archival sequence is considered authoritative.</p>

<p>The index is presented as a web browsable reconstruction of the CON40 series with each volume in its own file. Each entry for a convict provides links to the image of the conduct record page managed by [[[TAHO]]], the linked records which make up all the data known about the convict in the project, and a link to the convicts entry in the search system. Following the search link takes the user to the convict's life course display which includes all project data which has been matched and linked to that convict presented as a time sequenced set of events. 
</p>
<p>Complete details of the CON40 primary source maintained by [[[TAHO]]] sources can be referenced in related information.</p>
