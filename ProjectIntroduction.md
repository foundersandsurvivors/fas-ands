# Background and Context #

This project is a partnership between the University of Melbourne’s [eScholarship Research Centre](http://www.esrc.unimelb.edu.au/) and the [Founders and Survivors Project](http://foundersandsurvivors.org/).

The eScholarship Research Centre (ESRC) is a research centre in Information Services – an academic Centre outside the Faculty structure aimed at facilitating interdisciplinary, intra-institutional and inter-organisational collaboration. The Centre's strengths are in cultural informatics, archives, data preservation and sustainable information systems for research.

The Founders and Survivors Project has brought together a number of research data sets created from records relating to the 73,000 convicts transported to Tasmania in the 19th century and their descendents to create a population database of national and international significance for historical, demographic and population health researchers.

# Aims and Objectives #

The aims of this project are to:

  * Develop a toolkit based around project workflows for systematically ingesting data sets into the population database. The project utilises the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/)’s (TEI) XML standard for representing texts digitally.

  * Build and/or utilise infrastructure to facilitate persistent identification and description of derived data sets generated by researchers on demand from the population database. The information about derived data sets will be published to Research Data Australia.
